Dataset is from Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset
Thesis:
•	This dataset contains 30,000 rows and 26 columns and it has information about the credit card payment & defaulters for certain period in 2005 
•	All we need to do is to use the variables accordingly and predict which customers are more likely to default
